# ADR-0001: Azure Cloud Platform Choice

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-22  
**Deciders:** D-Mac, Platform Team  

## Context

FieldOps Support AI requires a cloud platform to host the Tier-1 assistant infrastructure, including API management, application services, databases, storage, monitoring, and security services. The system needs to integrate with enterprise identity systems and provide robust monitoring and logging capabilities.

## Decision

We will use **Microsoft Azure** as the primary cloud platform for FieldOps Support AI.

## Rationale

### Strong Enterprise Identity Integration
- **Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)** provides seamless integration with existing enterprise identity systems
- Native support for RBAC, conditional access, and multi-factor authentication
- Simplified user management and single sign-on capabilities
- Strong compliance and security posture for enterprise environments

### Comprehensive API Management
- **Azure API Management (APIM)** offers enterprise-grade API gateway capabilities
- Built-in developer portal, analytics, and API versioning
- Strong integration with Azure services and monitoring
- Support for multiple authentication methods and rate limiting
- Excellent documentation and developer experience

### Robust Monitoring and Observability
- **Azure Monitor and Log Analytics** provide comprehensive system observability
- Native integration across all Azure services
- Advanced querying capabilities with KQL (Kusto Query Language)
- Built-in alerting, dashboards, and automated responses
- Strong correlation between infrastructure and application metrics

### Security and Compliance
- **Azure Key Vault** for centralized secrets management
- Built-in compliance certifications (SOC, ISO, FedRAMP)
- Advanced threat protection and security monitoring
- Network isolation capabilities with VNets and Private Endpoints
- Strong data encryption at rest and in transit

### Hybrid and Edge Capabilities
- Excellent support for hybrid cloud scenarios
- Azure Arc for on-premises integration
- Strong networking capabilities for site-to-cloud connectivity
- Support for edge computing scenarios with Azure Stack Edge

## Alternatives Considered

### AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- **Pros:** Market leader, extensive service catalog, strong ecosystem
- **Cons:** More complex identity integration, higher learning curve for enterprise scenarios
- **Decision:** Ruled out due to more complex enterprise identity integration

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Pros:** Strong AI/ML capabilities, competitive pricing
- **Cons:** Smaller enterprise footprint, less mature identity services
- **Decision:** Ruled out due to limited enterprise identity ecosystem

### Multi-Cloud Approach
- **Pros:** Vendor diversification, best-of-breed services
- **Cons:** Increased complexity, higher operational overhead, inconsistent tooling
- **Decision:** Ruled out due to unnecessary complexity for Phase 1

## Consequences

### Positive
- Simplified enterprise identity integration reduces development time
- Comprehensive monitoring reduces operational complexity
- Strong security posture meets enterprise requirements
- Excellent documentation and support ecosystem
- Native integration between services reduces configuration complexity

### Negative
- Vendor lock-in to Microsoft ecosystem
- Potentially higher costs compared to some alternatives
- Learning curve for teams not familiar with Azure services

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) to maintain portability
- Design application layer to be cloud-agnostic where possible
- Implement monitoring and cost controls to manage expenses
- Invest in team training for Azure services

## Implementation Notes
- Start with Azure Free Tier for development
- Use Azure Reserved Instances for production cost optimization
- Implement resource tagging for cost tracking and governance
- Set up budget alerts and cost monitoring

## Review Date
This decision will be reviewed in 6 months (March 2026) or when significant architectural changes are considered.
