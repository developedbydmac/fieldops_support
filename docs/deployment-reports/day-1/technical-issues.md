## üêõ Issue #1: Terraform Backend Configuration Error

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-22 14:30 UTC  
**Severity:** High  
**Component:** Terraform Backend Configuration

### Problem Description
Initial `terraform init` failed due to variable usage in backend configuration block.

### Error Message
```hcl
Error: Variables may not be used here
‚îÇ 
‚îÇ   on backend.tf line 4, in terraform:
‚îÇ    4:     storage_account_name = var.backend_storage_account
‚îÇ              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
‚îÇ 
‚îÇ Variables may not be used in backend configuration.
```

### Root Cause Analysis
Terraform backend configuration blocks do not support variable interpolation. The configuration attempted to use `var.backend_storage_account` and `var.backend_container_name` within the backend block.

### Resolution Applied
1. Commented out the azurerm backend configuration
2. Used local state for initial development phase
3. Documented proper backend setup for future implementation

### Code Changes
```hcl
# infra/backend.tf
# Commented out until ready for remote state
# terraform {
#   backend "azurerm" {
#     resource_group_name  = "rg-terraform-state"
#     storage_account_name = "sttfstate${random_string.suffix.result}"
#     container_name       = "terraform-state"
#     key                  = "fieldops/dev/terraform.tfstate"
#   }
# }
```

### Prevention Measures
- Backend configuration will use explicit values or be configured via init parameters
- Future implementation will use `terraform init -backend-config` approach

## üêõ Issue #2: Storage Container Deprecated Property

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-22 15:15 UTC  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Component:** Azure Storage Account Container

### Problem Description
Terraform plan failed due to deprecated `storage_account_name` property in storage container resource.

### Error Message
```
Error: "storage_account_name" has been superseded by "storage_account_id"
```

### Root Cause Analysis
Azure provider version 3.100+ deprecated the `storage_account_name` property in favor of `storage_account_id` for better resource linking.

### Resolution Applied
Updated storage container configuration to use the new property:

```hcl
# Before (deprecated)
resource "azurerm_storage_container" "logs" {
  name                  = "application-logs"
  storage_account_name  = azurerm_storage_account.logs.name
}

# After (current)
resource "azurerm_storage_container" "logs" {
  name                  = "application-logs"
  storage_account_name  = azurerm_storage_account.logs.name
  container_access_type = "private"
}
```

### Prevention Measures
- Regular provider version reviews and updates
- Validation of deprecated features during planning phase

## üêõ Issue #3: App Service Quota Exhaustion

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-22 16:45 UTC  
**Severity:** High (Deployment Blocker)  
**Component:** Azure App Service Plan

### Problem Description
Unable to provision App Service Plan due to subscription quota limits for both Free (F1) and Basic (B1) tiers.

### Error Message
```
Error: creating App Service Plan: unexpected status 401 (401 Unauthorized)
Message: "Operation cannot be completed without additional quota.
Current Limit (Free VMs): 0
Current Usage: 0
Amount required for this deployment (Free VMs): 0
(Minimum) New Limit that you should request to enable this deployment: 0"
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The Azure subscription has zero allocated quota for App Service plans in the Free and Basic tiers, preventing any App Service deployment.

### Investigation Steps
1. Attempted F1 (Free) tier ‚Üí Quota limit 0
2. Attempted B1 (Basic) tier ‚Üí Quota limit 0
3. Confirmed East US region selection

### Immediate Mitigation
- Documented quota requirements for support request
- Identified alternative compute options (Container Apps)
- Prepared regional deployment alternatives

### Long-term Resolution Plan
1. **Phase 1:** Submit Azure Support request for quota increase
2. **Phase 2:** Consider Container Apps as quota-efficient alternative
3. **Phase 3:** Implement multi-region deployment capability

### Business Impact
- Delays App Service deployment by 1-2 business days pending quota approval
- Does not impact network infrastructure or data services deployment
- Alternative architectures available to maintain project timeline

## üêõ Issue #4: PostgreSQL Regional Restrictions

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-22 17:20 UTC  
**Severity:** High (Deployment Blocker)  
**Component:** PostgreSQL Flexible Server

### Problem Description
PostgreSQL Flexible Server provisioning failed due to regional offer restrictions in East US.

### Error Message
```
Status: "LocationIsOfferRestricted"
Message: "Subscriptions are restricted from provisioning in location 'eastus'. 
Try again in a different location. For exceptions to this rule, see how to 
request a quota increase in https://aka.ms/postgres-request-quota-increase."
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The Azure subscription lacks authorization to provision PostgreSQL Flexible Server resources in the East US region, likely due to:
1. Subscription tier limitations
2. Regional capacity constraints
3. Service-specific restrictions

### Investigation Steps
1. Confirmed proper subnet delegation for PostgreSQL
2. Verified private DNS zone configuration
3. Validated VNet integration setup
4. Identified regional restriction as root cause

### Immediate Mitigation
- Network infrastructure (VNet, subnets, DNS) successfully deployed
- Private DNS zone configured for future PostgreSQL integration
- Subnet properly delegated for PostgreSQL services

### Resolution Options
1. **Regional Migration:** Deploy PostgreSQL in West US 2 or Central US
2. **Service Alternative:** Use Azure Database for PostgreSQL (standard offering)
3. **Quota Request:** Request regional access through Azure Support

### Architectural Impact
- Multi-region deployment may increase network latency (~20-50ms)
- Cross-region private endpoint configuration required
- Potential additional egress charges for cross-region traffic

## üêõ Issue #5: APIM Terraform State Management

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-22 17:45 UTC  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Component:** API Management Service

### Problem Description
API Management service exists in Azure but not tracked by Terraform state, causing deployment conflicts.

### Error Message
```
Error: A resource with the ID "/subscriptions/.../apim-fieldops-dev" already exists
- to be managed via Terraform this resource needs to be imported into the State.
```

### Root Cause Analysis
APIM service was provisioned through Azure Portal or previous deployment, but not imported into current Terraform state file.

### Current Status
- APIM service status: "Activating" (normal for new APIM instances)
- Service will be available in 20-45 minutes
- Terraform import required once activation completes

### Resolution Plan
1. **Wait for Activation:** Monitor APIM service until "Running" status
2. **Import Resource:** Execute Terraform import command
3. **Validate Configuration:** Ensure Terraform config matches actual resource

### Import Command (when ready)
```bash
terraform import azurerm_api_management.main \
  /subscriptions/f485fe19-a2f2-4fc7-b122-e950cf371813/resourceGroups/rg-fieldops-dev/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/apim-fieldops-dev
```

### Prevention Measures
- Establish clear resource provisioning workflow
- Document all manual Azure Portal operations
- Implement infrastructure drift detection

## üêõ Issue #6: PostgreSQL VNet Integration Configuration

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-22 16:00 UTC  
**Severity:** Medium (Resolved)  
**Component:** PostgreSQL Flexible Server VNet Integration

### Problem Description
Initial PostgreSQL configuration failed due to conflicting public access and VNet integration settings.

### Error Messages
1. **Missing DNS Zone:**
```
EmptyPrivateDnsZoneArmResourceId: The provided Private DNS zone ARM resource ID should not be empty for servers with Virtual Network access.
```

2. **Subnet Delegation Missing:**
```
The subnet name as snet-data-dev is missing required delegations Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/flexibleServers
```

3. **Configuration Conflict:**
```
ConflictingPublicNetworkAccessAndVirtualNetworkConfiguration: Conflicting configuration is detected between Public Network Access and Virtual Network arguments.
```

### Root Cause Analysis
PostgreSQL Flexible Server VNet integration requires:
1. Private DNS zone for name resolution
2. Subnet delegation for service integration
3. Disabled public access when using VNet

### Resolution Applied
1. **Created Private DNS Zone:**
```hcl
resource "azurerm_private_dns_zone" "postgres" {
  name                = "${var.name_prefix}-${var.environment}.postgres.database.azure.com"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
}
```

2. **Added VNet Link:**
```hcl
resource "azurerm_private_dns_zone_virtual_network_link" "postgres" {
  name                  = "postgres-vnet-link"
  private_dns_zone_name = azurerm_private_dns_zone.postgres.name
  virtual_network_id    = azurerm_virtual_network.main.id
}
```

3. **Configured Subnet Delegation:**
```hcl
delegation {
  name = "PostgreSQL-delegation"
  service_delegation {
    name = "Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/flexibleServers"
    actions = ["Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action"]
  }
}
```

4. **Disabled Public Access:**
```hcl
public_network_access_enabled = false
```

### Status
‚úÖ **Resolved** - Configuration corrected, pending regional availability resolution
