# Automation Impact Analysis

This document is automatically generated from the automation catalog and shows the quantified impact of our automation initiatives.

## Summary Metrics

| Manual Task | Automated Solution | Time Saved (min) | Percent Faster | Compliance % |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|--------------|
| Manual server setup to Terraform IaC on Azure | Terraform modules with GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline | 110 | 91.7% | 95% |
| Monthly patching to Ansible playbooks using Arc or VMSS | Ansible automation with Azure Arc integration and compliance monitoring | 40 | 88.9% | 95% |
| User access requests to Azure RBAC as code | Terraform-managed RBAC with OPA policy validation and Key Vault integration | 18 | 90.0% | 100% |

## Key Insights

- **Total Time Saved per Cycle**: 168 minutes (2.8 hours)
- **Automation Coverage**: 3 critical processes automated
- **Average Compliance**: 96.7%

## Evidence and Validation

Each automation has associated evidence and validation artifacts:

### Infrastructure Provisioning
- **Tools**: Terraform, GitHub Actions, Azure Resource Manager
- **Evidence Paths**: infra/, evidence/provisioning/
- **Impact**: Transform manual Azure resource creation into repeatable Infrastructure as Code deployments

### Patch Management
- **Tools**: Ansible, ansible-lint, Log Analytics
- **Evidence Paths**: ops/, config/, evidence/patching/
- **Impact**: Automate monthly security patching from manual server-by-server updates to orchestrated deployments

### Access Management
- **Tools**: Terraform, OPA, Key Vault RBAC
- **Evidence Paths**: infra/, evidence/iam/
- **Impact**: Convert manual access requests into policy-driven RBAC automation with complete audit trails
